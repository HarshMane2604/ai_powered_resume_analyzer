Pune
•Faced the challenge of building a user-friendly interface for a React.js SaaS application; solved it by developing and maintaining a responsive frontend that improved usability and accessibility.
•Needed a way for users to schedule meetings and manage workspaces easily; addressed this by creating workspace modules and meeting scheduling features, integrating seamlessly with Google Calendar APIs.
•Users struggled to quickly access meeting insights; fixed this by implementing an interactive chatbot with knowledge chips, allowing faster and more efficient interaction.
•Code duplication and poor scalability were bottlenecks; resolved them by designing and optimizing reusable React components, ensuring long-term maintainability.
•The application had performance lags due to inefficient rendering; overcame this by applying React hooks, state management, and optimization techniques, which significantly enhanced UI performance.
Projects
AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPER AGENT (AI-POWERED CODE ASSISTANT)
Tech Stack: Python, LangChain/LangGraph, OpenAI API, GitHub API, Shell Tools

• Built an AI agent that understands entire codebases and assists developers by fixing bugs, improving logic, and generating documentation automatically.

• Replaced manual switching between terminal, editor, and docs with a natural-language interface that reads files, applies changes, and runs commands on its own.

• Solved code consistency and quality issues by enabling the agent to refactor code and generate clean, structured Git commits through GitHub API integration.

• Streamlined the development workflow by automating repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort, and making everyday programming faster and more reliable.

Project: Amazon Product Scraper
Tech Stack: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Fake-UserAgent, Proxy Server

•Many people struggle to gather product data from e-commerce sites efficiently. I solved this by building a Python-based scraper that extracts product titles, prices, and ratings in real time.
•Unlike manual data collection, this tool uses proxies and user-agent rotation to bypass restrictions and ensure consistent scraping.
•To keep it simple yet powerful, I designed it to run from the command line with clean, structured output—perfect for quick market analysis and automation.
